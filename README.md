# migdalMC
Basic MC tool for generating random Migdal events

Presently there are only two targets implemented: xenon and argon

## Dependencies

The only required library is GSL

## Building

Type "make" in the main directory, the executable migdalMC will be created which has a minimal implementation - it will take command line input and produce one event as an example.
